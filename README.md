## Overview

This repository contains the code and data associated with the FRBC’s Economic Commentary “How Insured Are Workers Against Unemployment? Unemployment Insurance and the Distribution of Liquid Wealth” by André Victor D. Luduvice and Anaya Truss-Williams.   

The data and code in this replication package implement the data transformations and calculations from three data sources (U.S. Census SIPP, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the U.S. Department of Labor via Haver Analytics) using R. The Master script and Transformation script run the replication package and implement all data transformation and calculations required for the analysis. The Figures and Appendix scripts generate the figures and tables.

This Commentary uses raw data from the BLS. The raw data is the seasonally adjusted CPI-U index, series ID: CUSR0000SA0. Data can be freely downloaded from `https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUSR0000SA0&output`. Change output options to include years 1947 - 2024, and the "Original Data Value" (Column Format) view of the data. Note: the raw CPI-U index data file is provided in the Data folder as BLS_CPI-U_1947_2024.xlsx and was extracted on July 11, 2024.

This Commentary uses aggregated data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration (DOLETA) gathered via Haver Analytics. The raw continued claims and labor force levels data can also be retrieved freely from the links provided below. Note: the unemployment rate, continued claims, and labor force data are provided in the Data folder in the file Haver_LF_Data.xlsx. This is shared with permission.
